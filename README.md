## Resources

* [MDN position summary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) I used this link as a resource as I began layout out my styletile prototype. I wanted to make sure I was positioning the elements with mobile-first design in mind.

## Comments

Throughout the project, I focused on keeping a consistent style for this project. I wanted to stay true to the brand and make decisions based on the content I need on the site even when I was focusing on the style. When I picked the fonts, I thought about what would be easy to read but stay consistent with the brand. I chose the more freehand font for larger headlines and the menu section to look handwritten just as boards were done at the banana stand. Then I chose a complimentary but still very readable body san-serif font for the main content. I wanted the style to compliment the content, not the other way around. I hope I did so through this project. I also stepped out of my comfort zone and experimented with using colors as backgrounds for the site. I broke up the different sections of the page with different background colors that I pulled from the banana stand image and that went well together. I believe they are flat enough to not take away from the content but rather break up the page to help readers know where they are in the site.
